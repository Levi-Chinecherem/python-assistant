- Required Python packages (install using `pip`):
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `SpeechRecognition`
  - `pyaudio`
  - `wikipedia`
  - `pywhatkit`
  - `ecapture`
  - `pyjokes`
  - `speedtest-cli`
  - `pywikihow`
  - `pyAutoGUI`
  - `poetpy`
  - `forex-python`
  - `requests`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Levi-Chinecherem/python-assistant.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition pyaudio wikipedia pywhatkit ecapture pyjokes speedtest-cli pywikihow pyAutoGUI poetpy forex-python requests beautifulsoup4 wolframalpha quote winshell geopy geocoder turtle pillow
   ```
3. Run the Python Assistant:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the Python Assistant is running, it will greet you and listen for your voice commands. Speak clearly and concisely, and wait for the assistant to respond. You can use commands like "open YouTube," "tell me a joke," or "what's the weather today."
